How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I looked in the new code and found a mistake. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I make mistake it is easier to find what went wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros are that I can commit exacly in time when i am finissh with something.  cons are that I can somethimes forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Because in Git we usually save whole Projects.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to se id of each commit and git diff to compare two different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can alwas get back to the previous solution if something break

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For almost everything :-)
